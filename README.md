# Spring Learning Project

This repository is part of my journey in learning Spring framework.

## Tools and Requirements

### IDE
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development.

### Dependency Manager
- **Maven**: No separate installation required as it is integrated into IntelliJ IDEA.

### Application Server
- **Tomcat**: Spring Boot comes with an embedded Tomcat server, so no separate installation is needed.

### Testing Tools
- **Postman**: Used for testing RESTful APIs. You can download it from [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Database Server
- **MySQL**: To set up the database, you'll need to install either [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for MySQL server.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hafedh-Jendoubi/SpringProject.git
    cd SpringProject
    ```

2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.

3. Set up your MySQL database:
    - Install WAMP or XAMPP if you haven't already.
    - Create a new MySQL database and configure your `application.properties` file with the correct database URL, username, and password.

4. Run the project:
    - In **IntelliJ IDEA**, run the project from the main class (usually `Application.java`).
    - The Spring Boot application will start with the embedded Tomcat server.

5. Test the API:
    - Use **Postman** to test the REST APIs.

## API Documentation

- Endpoints and detailed usage will be documented as the project progresses.
